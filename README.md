Here it is! This bastard of a project that made me give up on Web Design soooooo many times!!!
Finally it got slain! I did get lucky to find free API on freecodecamp (I wrote url in the file, just in case I might
need it later) but we will write that down to just being skillful ;)

Anyway, it was nice project and it was not that hard, especially since I did learn how to manipulate DOM to some extent.

Well, see ya in next project!
